# Modern C Guidelines

Modern rules and proven practices how to code in C. Originally based on [Matt
Stancliff's blog post How to C in 2016](https://matt.sh/howto-c) plus changes
suggested and/or made by [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

The first rule of C is don't write C if you can avoid it.

If you must write in C, you should follow modern rules.

C has been around since the [early
1970s](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html). People have "learned
C" at various points during its evolution, but knowledge usually get stuck
after learning, so everybody has a different set of things they believe about C
based on the year(s) they first started learning.

It's important to not remain stuck in your "things I learned in the 80s/90s"
mindset of C development.

This page assumes you are on a modern platform conforming to modern standards
and you have no excessive legacy compatibility requirements. We shouldn't be
globally tied to ancient standards just because some companies refuse to
upgrade 20 year old systems.

## Preflight
Standard c99 (c99 means "C Standard from 1999"; c11 means "C Standard from
2011", so 11 > 99).

  - clang, default
    - C99 is the default C implementation for clang, no extra options needed.
        - clang's default is actually a C99 variant with slightly non-standard
          behavior, so still specify `-std=c99` if you want standard C99.
    - If you want C11, you need to specify `-std=c11`
    - clang compiles your source files faster than gcc
  - gcc requires you specify `-std=c99` or `-std=c11`
    - gcc builds source files slower than clang, but _sometimes_ generates
      faster code. Performance comparisons and regression testings are
      important.
    - gcc-5 defaults to `-std=gnu11`, but you should still specify a non-GNU
      `c99` or `c11` for practical usage.

### Optimizations

  - -O2, -O3
    - generally you want `-O2`, but sometimes you want `-O3`. Test under both
      levels (and across compilers) then keep the best performing binaries.
  - -Os
    - `-Os` helps if your concern is cache efficiency (which it should be)

### Warnings

  - `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`
    - [newer compiler
      versions](https://twitter.com/oliviergay/status/685389448142565376) have
      `-Wpedantic`, but they still accept the ancient `-pedantic` as well for
      wider backwards compatibility.
  - during testing you should add `-Werror` and `-Wshadow` on all your platforms
    - it can be tricky deploying production source using `-Werror` because
      different platforms and compilers and libraries can emit different
      warnings. You probably don't want to kill a user's entire build just
      because their version of GCC on a platform you've never seen complains in
      new and wonderous ways.
  - extra fancy options include `-Wstrict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing`
    - Either specify `-fno-strict-aliasing` or be sure to only access objects
      as the type they have at creation. Since so much existing C code aliases
      across types, using `-fno-strict-aliasing` is a much safer bet if you
      don't control the entire underlying source tree.
  - as of now, Clang reports some valid syntax as a warning, so you should add
    `-Wno-missing-field-initializers`
    - GCC fixed this unnecessary warning after GCC 4.7.0

### Building

  - Compilation units
    - The most common way of building C projects is to decompose every source
      file into an object file then link all the objects together at the end.
      This procedure works great for incremental development, but it is
      suboptimal for performance and optimization. Your compiler can't detect
      potential optimization across file boundaries this way.
  - LTO â€” Link Time Optimization
    - LTO fixes the "source analysis and optimization across compilation units
      problem" by annotating object files with intermediate representation so
      source-aware optimizations can be carried out across compilation units at
      link time (this slows down the linking process noticeably, but `make -j`
      helps).
    - [clang LTO](http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html)
      ([guide](http://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html))
    - [gcc LTO](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html)
    - As of 2016, clang and gcc releases support LTO by just adding `-flto` to
      your command line options during object compilation and final
      library/program linking.
    - `LTO` still needs some babysitting though. Sometimes, if your program
      has code not used directly but used by additional libraries, LTO can
      evict functions or code because it detects, globally when linking, some
      code is unused/unreachable and doesn't *need* to be included in the final
      linked result.

### Arch

  - `-march=native`
    - give the compiler permission to use your CPU's full feature set
    - again, performance testing and regression testing is important (then
      comparing the results across multiple compilers and/or compiler versions)
      is important to make sure any enabled optimizations don't have adverse
      side effects.
  - `-msse2` and `-msse4.2` may be useful if you need to target
    not-your-build-machine features.

## Writing code

### Types

If you find yourself typing `char` or `int` or `short` or `long` or `unsigned`
into new code, you're doing it wrong.

For modern programs, you should `#include <stdint.h>` then use _standard_
types.

The common standard types are:

  - `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t` â€” signed integers
  - `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t` â€” unsigned integers
  - `float` â€” standard 32-bit floating point
  - `double` - standard 64-bit floating point

Notice we don't have `char` anymore. `char` is actually misnamed and misused in
C.

Developers routinely abuse `char` to mean "byte" even when they are doing
unsigned byte manipulations.
It's much cleaner to use `uint8_t` to mean single a unsigned-byte/octet-value
and `uint8_t *` to mean sequence-of-unsigned-byte/octet-values.

#### One Exception to never-`char`
The *only* acceptable use of `char` in 2016 is if a pre-existing API requires
`char` (e.g. `strncat`, printf'ing "%s", ...) or if you're initializing a
read-only string (e.g. `const char *hello = "hello";`) because the C type of
string literals (`"hello"`) is `char *`.

ALSO: In C11 we have native unicode support, and the type of UTF-8 string
literals is still `char *` even for multibyte sequences like `const char
*abcgrr = u8"abcðŸ˜¬";`.

#### Signedness
At no point should you be typing the word `unsigned` into your code. We can
now write code without the ugly C convention of multi-word types that impair
readability as well as usage. Who wants to type `unsigned long long int` when
you can type `uint64_t`?  The `<stdint.h>` types are more _explicit_, more
_exact_ in meaning, convey _intentions_ better, and are more _compact_ for
typographic _usage_ and _readability_.

But, you may say, "I need to cast pointers to `long` for dirty pointer math!"

You may say that. But you are wrong.

The correct type for pointer math is `uintptr_t` defined in `<stddef.h>`.

Instead of:

```c
long diff = (long)ptrOld - (long)ptrNew;
```

Use:

```c
ptrdiff_t diff = (uintptr_t)ptrOld - (uintptr_t)ptrNew;
```

#### System-Dependent Types

You continue arguing, "on a 32 bit platform I want 32 bit longs and on a 64 bit
platform I want 64 bit longs!"

If we skip over the line of thinking where you are _deliberately_ introducing
difficult to reason about code by using two different sizes depending on
platform, you still don't want to use `long` for system-dependent types.

In these situations, you should use `intptr_t` â€” the integer type defined to be
the word size of your current platform.

On 32-bit platforms, `intptr_t` is `int32_t`.

On 64-bit platforms, `intptr_t` is `int64_t`.

`intptr_t` also comes in a `uintptr_t` flavor.

For holding pointer offsets, we have the aptly named `ptrdiff_t` which is the
proper type for storing values of subtracted pointers.

#### Maximum Value Holders

Do you need an integer type capable of holding any integer usable on your
system?

People tend to use the largest known type in this case, such as casting smaller
unsigned types to `uint64_t`, but there's a more technically correct way to
guarantee any value can hold any other value.

The safest container for any integer is `intmax_t` (also `uintmax_t`).
You can assign or cast any signed integer to `intmax_t` with no loss of
precision, and you can assign or cast any unsigned integer to `uintmax_t` with
no loss of precision.

#### That Other Type

The most widely used system-dependent type is `size_t`.

`size_t` is defined as "an integer capable of holding the largest array index"
which also means it's capable of holding the largest memory offset in your
program.

In practical use, `size_t` is the return type of `sizeof` operator.

In either case: `size_t` is _practically_ defined to be the same as `uintptr_t`
on all modern platforms, so on a 32-bit platform `size_t` is `uint32_t` and on
a 64-bit platform `size_t` is `uint64_t`.

There is also `ssize_t` which is a signed `size_t` used as the return value
from library functions that return `-1` on error. (Note: `ssize_t` is POSIX so
does not apply to Windows interfaces.)

So, should you use `size_t` for arbitrary system-dependent sizes in your own
function parameters?  Technically, `size_t` is the return type of `sizeof`, so
any functions accepting a size value representing a number of bytes is allowed
to be a `size_t`.

Other uses include: `size_t` is the type of the argument to malloc, and
`ssize_t` is the return type of `read()` and `write()` (except on Windows where
`ssize_t` doesn't exist and the return values are just `int`).


#### Printing Types

You should never cast types during printing. You should use proper type
specifiers.

These include, but are not limited to:

  - `size_t` - `%zu`
  - `ssize_t` - `%zd`
  - `ptrdiff_t` - `%td`
  - raw pointer value - `%p` (prints hex value; cast your pointer to `(void *)`
    first)
  - 64-bit types should be printed using `PRIu64` (unsigned) and `PRId64`
    (signed)
    - on some platforms a 64-bit value is a `long` and on others it's a `long
      long`
    - it is actually impossible to specify a correct cross-platform format
      string without these format macros because the types change out from
      under you (and remember, casting values before printing is not safe or
      logical).
  - `intptr_t` â€” `"%" PRIdPTR`
  - `uintptr_t` â€” `"%" PRIuPTR`
  - `intmax_t` â€” `"%" PRIdMAX`
  - `uintmax_t` â€” `"%" PRIuMAX`

One note about the `PRI*` formatting specifiers: they are *macros* and the
macros expand to proper *printf* type specifiers on a platform-specific basis.
This means you can't do:

```c
printf("Local number: %PRIdPTR\n\n", someIntPtr);
```

but instead, because they are macros, you do:

```c
printf("Local number: %" PRIdPTR "\n\n", someIntPtr);
```

Notice you put the '%' *inside* your format string, but the type specifier is
*outside* your format string.


### C99 allows variable declarations anywhere

So, do NOT do this:

```c
void test(uint8_t input) {
    uint32_t b;

    if (input > 3) {
        return;
    }

    b = input;
}
```

do THIS instead:

```c
void test(uint8_t input) {
    if (input > 3) {
        return;
    }

    uint32_t b = input;
}
```

Caveat: if you have tight loops, test the placement of your initializers.
Sometimes scattered declarations can cause unexpected slowdowns. For regular
non-fast-path code (which is most of everything in the world), it's best to be
as clear as possible, and defining types next to your initializations is a big
readability improvement.

### C99 allows `for` loops to declare counters inline

So, do NOT do this:

```c
    uint32_t i;

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < 10; i++)
```

One exception: if you need to retain your counter value after the loop exits,
obviously don't declare your counter scoped to the loop itself.

### Modern compilers support `#pragma once`

So, do NOT do this:

```c
#ifndef PROJECT_HEADERNAME
#define PROJECT_HEADERNAME
.
.
.
#endif /* PROJECT_HEADERNAME */
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
#pragma once
```

`#pragma once` tells the compiler to only include your header once and you *do
not* need three lines of header guards anymore. This pragma is widely
supported across all compilers across all platforms and is recommended over
manually naming header guards.

For more details, see list of supported compilers at [pragma
once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragma_once).

### C allows static initialization of auto-allocated arrays

So, do NOT do this:

```c
    uint32_t numbers[64];
    memset(numbers, 0, sizeof(numbers));
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
    uint32_t numbers[64] = {0};
```

### C allows static initialization of auto-allocated structs

So, do NOT do this:

```c
    struct thing {
        uint64_t index;
        uint32_t counter;
    };

    struct thing localThing;

    void initThing(void) {
        memset(&localThing, 0, sizeof(localThing));
    }
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
    struct thing {
        uint64_t index;
        uint32_t counter;
    };

    struct thing localThing = {0};
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If your struct has padding, the `{0}` method does not zero
out extra padding bytes. For example, `struct thing` has 4 bytes of padding
after `counter` (on a 64-bit platform) because structs are padded to word-sized
increments. If you need to zero out an entire struct *including* unused
padding, use `memset(&localThing, 0, sizeof(localThing))` because
`sizeof(localThing) == 16 bytes` even though the addressable contents is only
`8 + 4 = 12 bytes`.

If you need to re-initialize already allocated structs, declare a zero-struct
for later assignment:

```c
    struct thing {
        uint64_t index;
        uint32_t counter;
    };

    static const struct thing localThingNull = {0};
    .
    .
    .
    struct thing localThing = {.counter = 3};
    .
    .
    .
    localThing = localThingNull;
```


### C99 allows variable length array initializers

So, do NOT do this:

```c
    uintmax_t arrayLength = strtoumax(argv[1], NULL, 10);
    void *array[];

    array = malloc(sizeof(*array) * arrayLength);

    /* remember to free(array) when you're done using it */
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
    uintmax_t arrayLength = strtoumax(argv[1], NULL, 10);
    void *array[arrayLength];

    /* no need to free array */
```

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT:** variable length arrays are (usually) stack allocated just
like regular arrays. If you wouldn't create a 3 million element regular array
statically, don't attempt to create a 3 million element array at runtime using
this syntax. These are not scalable python/ruby auto-growing lists. If you
specify a runtime array length and the length is too big for your stack, your
program will do awful things (crashes, security issues). Variable Length
Arrays are convenient for small, single-purpose situations, but should not be
relied on at scale in production software. If sometimes you need a 3 element
array and other times a 3 million element array, definitely do not use the
variable length array capability.

It's good to be aware of the VLA syntax in case you encounter it live (or want
it for quick one-off testing), but it can almost be considered a [dangerous
anti-pattern](https://twitter.com/grynspan/status/685509158024691712) since you
can crash your programs fairly simple by forgetting element size bounds checks
or by forgetting you are on a strange target platform with no free stack space.

NOTE: You must be certain `arrayLength` is a reasonable size in this situation.
(i.e. less than a few KB, sometime your stack will max out at 4 KB on weird
platforms). You can't stack allocate _huge_ arrays (millions of entries), but
if you know you have a limited count, it's much easier to use [C99
VLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_array) capabilities rather
than manually requesting heap memory from malloc.

DOUBLE NOTE: there is no user input checking above, so the user can easily kill
your program by allocating a giant VLA. [Some
people](https://twitter.com/comex/status/685423016981966848) go as far to call
VLAs an anti-pattern, but if you keep your bounds tight, it can be a tiny win
in certain situations.

### C99 allows annotating non-overlapping pointer parameters

See the [restrict keyword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict) (often
`__restrict`)

### Parameter Types

If a function accepts **arbitrary** input data and a length to process, don't
restrict
the type of the parameter.

So, do NOT do this:

```c
void processAddBytesOverflow(uint8_t *bytes, uint32_t len) {
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        bytes[0] += bytes[i];
    }
}
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
void processAddBytesOverflow(void *input, uint32_t len) {
    uint8_t *bytes = input;

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        bytes[0] += bytes[i];
    }
}
```

The input types to your functions describe the _interface_ to your code, not
what your code is doing with the parameters. The interface to the code above
means "accept a byte array and a length", so you don't want to restrict your
callers to only uint8_t byte streams. Maybe your users even want to pass in
old-style `char *` values or something else unexpected.

By declaring your input type as `void *` and re-casting inside your function,
you save the users of your function from having to think about abstractions
_inside_ your own library.

### Return Parameter Types

C99 gives us the power of `<stdbool.h>` which defines `true` to `1` and `false`
to `0`.

For success/failure return values, functions should return `true` or `false`,
not an `int32_t` return type with manually specifying `1` and `0` (or worse,
`1` and `-1` (or is it `0` success and `1` failure?  or is it `0` success and
`-1` failure?)).

If a function mutates an input parameter to the extent the parameter is
invalidated, instead of returning the altered pointer, your entire API should
force double pointers as parameters anywhere an input can be invalidated.
Coding with "for some calls, the return value invalidates the input" is too
error prone for mass usage.

So, do NOT do this:

```c
void *growthOptional(void *grow, size_t currentLen, size_t newLen) {
    if (newLen > currentLen) {
        void *newGrow = realloc(grow, newLen);
        if (newGrow) {
            /* resize success */
            grow = newGrow;
        } else {
            /* resize failed, free existing and signal failure through NULL */
            free(grow);
            grow = NULL;
        }
    }

    return grow;
}
```

Do THIS instead:

```c
/* Return value:
 *  - 'true' if newLen > currentLen and attempted to grow
 *    - 'true' does not signify success here, the success is still in '*_grow'
 *  - 'false' if newLen <= currentLen */
bool growthOptional(void **_grow, size_t currentLen, size_t newLen) {
    void *grow = *_grow;
    if (newLen > currentLen) {
        void *newGrow = realloc(grow, newLen);
        if (newGrow) {
            /* resize success */
            *_grow = newGrow;
            return true;
        }

        /* resize failure */
        free(grow);
        *_grow = NULL;

        /* for this function,
         * 'true' doesn't mean success, it means 'attempted grow' */
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

Or, even better, Do THIS instead:

```c
typedef enum growthResult {
    GROWTH_RESULT_SUCCESS = 1,
    GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_GROW_NOT_NECESSARY,
    GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_ALLOCATION_FAILED
} growthResult;

growthResult growthOptional(void **_grow, size_t currentLen, size_t newLen) {
    void *grow = *_grow;
    if (newLen > currentLen) {
        void *newGrow = realloc(grow, newLen);
        if (newGrow) {
            /* resize success */
            *_grow = newGrow;
            return GROWTH_RESULT_SUCCESS;
        }

        /* resize failure, don't remove data because we can signal error */
        return GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_ALLOCATION_FAILED;
    }

    return GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_GROW_NOT_NECESSARY;
}
```


### Formatting

Coding style is simultaneously very important and utterly worthless.

If your project has a 50 page coding style guideline, nobody will help you.
But, if your code isn't readable, nobody will *want* to help you.

The solution here is to **always** use an automated code formatter.

The only usable C formatter as of 2016 is
[clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). clang-format has
the best defaults of any automatic C formatter and is still actively developed.

Here's my preferred script to run clang-format with good parameters:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

clang-format -style="{BasedOnStyle: llvm, IndentWidth: 4, AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None, KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: false}" "$@"
```

Then call it as (assuming you named the script `cleanup-format`):

```bash
$ cleanup-format -i *.{c,h,cc,cpp,hpp,cxx}
```

The `-i` option overwrites existing files in place with formatting changes
instead of writing to new files or creating backup files.

If you have many files, you can recursively process an entire source tree in parallel:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# note: clang-tidy only accepts one file at a time, but we can run it
#       parallel against disjoint collections at once.
find . \( -name \*.c -or -name \*.cpp -or -name \*.cc \) \
    | xargs -n1 -P4 cleanup-tidy

# clang-format accepts multiple files during one run, but let's limit it to 12
# here so we (hopefully) avoid excessive memory usage.
find . \( -name \*.c -or -name \*.cpp -or -name \*.cc -or -name \*.h \) \
    | xargs -n12 -P4 cleanup-format -i
```

Now, there's a new cleanup-tidy script there. The contents of `cleanup-tidy` is:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

clang-tidy \
    -fix \
    -fix-errors \
    -header-filter=.* \
    --checks=readability-braces-around-statements,misc-macro-parentheses \
    $1 \
    -- -I.
```

[clang-tidy](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) is policy driven code
refactoring tool. The options above enable two fixups:

  - `readability-braces-around-statements` â€” force all `if`/`while`/`for`
    statement bodies to be enclosed in braces
    - It's an accident of history for C to have "brace optional" single
      statements after loop constructs and conditionals. It is *inexcusable*
      to write modern code without braces enforced on every loop and every
      conditional. Trying to argue "but, the compiler accepts it!" has
      *nothing* to do with the readabiltiy, maintainability, understandability,
      or skimability of code. You aren't programming to please your compiler,
      you are programming to please future people who have to maintain your
      current brain state years after everybody has forgotten why anything
      exists in the first place.
  - `misc-macro-parentheses` â€” automatically add parens around all parameters
    used in macro bodies

`clang-tidy` is great when it works, but for some complex code bases it can get
stuck. Also, `clang-tidy` doesn't *format*, so you need to run `clang-format`
after you tidy to align new braces and reflow macros.

### Readability

*the writing seems to start slowing down here...*

#### Comments
logical self-contained portions of code file

#### File Structure
Try to limit files to a max of 1,000 lines (1,500 lines in really bad cases).
If your tests are in-line with your source file (for testing static functions,
etc), adjust as necessary.

### Misc thoughts

#### Never use `malloc`

You should always use `calloc`. There is no performance penalty for getting
zero'd memory. If you don't like the function protype of `calloc(object count,
size per object)` you can wrap it with `#define mycalloc(N) calloc(1, N)`.

Readers have commented on a few things here:

  - `calloc` *does* have a performance impact for **huge** allocations
  - `calloc` *does* have a performance impact on weird platforms (minimal
    embedded systems, game consoles, 30 year old hardware, ...)
  - wrapping `calloc(element count, size of each element)` is not always a good
    idea.
  - a good reason to avoid `malloc()` is it can't check for integer overflow
    and is a potential security risk

Those are good points, and that's why we always must do performance testing and
regression testing for speed across compilers, platforms, operating systems,
and hardware devices.

One advantage of using `calloc()` directly without a wrapper is, unlike
`malloc()`, `calloc()` can check for integer overflow because it multiplies its
arguments together to obtain your final allocation size. If you are only
allocating tiny things, wrapping `calloc()` is fine. If you are allocating
potentially unbounded streams of data, you may want to retain the regular
`calloc(element count, size of each element)` calling convention.

No advice can be universal, but trying to give *exactly perfect* generic
recommendations would end up reading like a book of language specifications.

For references on how `calloc()` gives you clean memory for free, see these
nice writeups:

  - [Benchmarking fun with calloc() and zero pages
    (2007)](https://blogs.fau.de/hager/archives/825)
  - [Copy-on-write in virtual memory
    management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#Copy-on-write_in_virtual_memory_management)

I still stand by my recommendation of always using `calloc()` for most common
scenarios of 2016 (assumption: x64 target platforms, human-sized data, not
including human genome-sized data). Any deviations from "expected" drag us
into the pit of despair of "domain knowledge," which are words we shan't speak
this day.

Subnote: The pre-zero'd memory delivered to you by `calloc()` is a one-shot
deal. If you `realloc()` your `calloc()` allocation, the grown memory extended
by realloc is *not* new zero'd out memory. Your grown allocation is filled
with whatever regular uninitialized contents your kernel provides. If you need
zero'd memory after a realloc, you must manually `memset()` the extent of your
grown allocation.

#### Never memset (if you can avoid it)

Never `memset(ptr, 0, len)` when you can statically initialize a structure (or
array) to zero (or reset it back to zero by assigning from a global zero'd out
structure). Though, `memset()` is your only choice if you need to zero out a
struct containing padding (because `{0}` only sets defined fields, not padding
bytes).

### Closing

Writing correct code at scale is essentially impossible. We have multiple
operating systems, runtimes, libraries, and hardware platforms to worry about
without even considering things like random bit flips in RAM or our block
devices lying to us with unknown probability.

The best we can do is write simple, understandable code with as few
indirections and as little undocumented magic as possible.
